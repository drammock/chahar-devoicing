The Mongolian languages (ISO 639-3: `khk`, `mvf`; macrolanguage `mon`) are vowel-harmony languages, involving some form of pharyngeal/tongue-root harmony and rounding harmony in all dialects [@SvantessonEtAl2005]. Thus the quality of most vowels in polysyllabic words are fully or partially predictable from other vowels in the word, and the lexical information load on any given vowel is correspondingly diminished. Possibly in consequence of this, vowel devoicing and deletion are frequently observable in Mongolian conversational speech, and also occur in more formal registers.

In this study, we analyze initial-syllable vowel devoicing and deletion in a wordlist corpus encompassing all attested C₁VC₂ sequences in the initial syllable in Chahar Mongolian (21558 tokens comprising 845 initial syllable types and 1204 unique words). Talkers were 3 male and 3 female native speakers of Chahar. Words were read in a sentence frame, and the entire word list was recorded three times by each talker. Vowel reduction for each token was classified by spectrographic assessment using a 3-way scheme: when there was no apparent duration between C₁ and C₂ on the spectrogram, vowels were classified as “deleted”; vowels with an apparent duration but no voicing bar and no visible formants were classified as “devoiced”; other vowels were classified as “unreduced”.

Probability of vowel reduction was modeled using cumulative-link mixed effects regression, with fixed effects for flanking consonant manner, flanking consonant aspiration, whether C₂ is intervocalic or the first element of a cluster, and list repetition number. Random effects were modeled for talker, vowel, and word.

Results show that the best predictors of vowel reduction are aspiration of a flanking consonant (either preceding or following) and frication directly adjacent to the vowel (i.e., if preceded by an affricate or either preceded or followed by a fricative). The fact that aspirated stops and affricates cause reduction even in C₂ position is consistent with the fact that non-initial stops and affricates are pre-aspirated in some dialects of Mongolian [@SvantessonKarlsson], a phenomenon which is not yet well-established for Chahar but does appear in this corpus. An additional finding is that frication and aspiration in C₂ position are more likely to cause vowel reduction when intervocalic (C₁VC₂V) than when clustered (C₁VC₂C₃V), though both devoicing and deletion in both word types are attested in our data.

Results are discussed in light of three potentially conflicting forces: articulatory ease [cf. @Lindblom1990], phonetic cue preservation [cf. @Wright2004], and position of word stress. The fact that affricates in C₁ position pattern with fricatives while affricates in C₂ position pattern with stops is a particularly telling indication that vowel devoicing and deletion in Chahar Mongolian are phonetically conditioned, not phonologically conditioned. The relationship of this phenomenon to patterns of vowel length and vowel harmony are discussed, along with its status as stable variation versus a change-in-progress.
